What was the age at which Padmanabhan joined Infosys?<br>Solution :<br>Part I. During Padmanabhan's Joining at Infosys<br>Jambu's age = 60 months<br>Part II. Current Ages<br>Since Padmanabhan had joined 80 month's back, Jambu's current age = Jambu's age when Padmanabhan joined Infosys + 80 = 60 + 80 = 140 months<br>(According to data in question) Mohanraj's current age = 80 months + 6 x Jambu's age when Padmanabhan joined Infosys = 80 + 6 x 60 = 440 months<br>Part III.
