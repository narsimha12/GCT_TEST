The preposition ‘at’ is used with a place or a location, which we see in the example statement “My friend at work is from Japan”. Here, ‘at’ signifies that the subject is located at ‘work’. The preposition ‘on’ is used to indicate a position, which as seen in the second example statement, refers to the position of “strike”. ‘Between’ is used when there are two separate points of reference mentioned, which, as we see in the third example statement, ‘you’ and ‘me’.<br>",
